# Autoencoder based Image Compression

The aim of this project is to build on current works in lossy Compressive Autoencoders (CAE).

The file Simple CAE MNIST translates the work found from [1] into PyTorch and modifies the model to improve performance. This is an example project the will be removed once the project progresses.
